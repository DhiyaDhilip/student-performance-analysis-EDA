# student-performance-analysis-EDA
Data analysis project exploring student academic performance using Python. Includes data cleaning, feature engineering, EDA, visualization, and regression modeling. Model performance evaluated and saved using Joblib.

#  Student Performance Analysis (EDA Project)

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes student performance data to understand academic trends and influencing factors using exploratory data analysis and visualization techniques.

##  Objectives
- Analyze student academic performance
- Identify factors influencing scores
- Build a predictive regression model

##  Tools & Technologies
- Python 3
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Joblib

##  Workflow
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
2. Handling missing and categorical data  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Feature Engineering  
5. Regression model training  
6. Model saving using Joblib  

##  Key Insights
- Study time and attendance positively impact performance
- Previous scores strongly influence final results
- Visual analysis highlighted performance gaps
